This project examines values of air pollutant PM 2.5 against its corresponding Air Quality Index (AQI) to determine whether they exhibit safe or unsafe conditions in Kolkata.
Furthermore, we build machine learning models by loading and splitting the dataset into training and testing set. Then, we apply feature scaling to normalize the range of values to ensure that all the values are in the same scale. THen, we visualize the graph results using the plotting library matplotlib.
The findings of the study reveal that Random Forest is the best-suited models as it gives the highest accuracy.
